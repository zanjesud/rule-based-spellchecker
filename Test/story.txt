Last week, the comittee gathered to adress the goverment’s new statment. “We must recieve the neccessary documents before tomorow,” said the chairman, who was embarassed by his earlier mispell of “accomodate.” The arguement about the shipment’s occassion was intense, but everyone agreed it was definately important.
Meanwhile, Sarah tried to seperate the files, but her proggraming script failed due to a smple error. “I’ll reapply the function,” she said, unhappy with her previous attempt. Her friend, who was quite kind, offered to help, saying, “Don’t worry, we’ll fix the cacke recipe and the adress labels too!”
Later, the children played outside, making a not of every bird they saw. Their happiness was apparent, and their laughter endless. By evening, the goverment’s decision was announced, and the comittee celebrated with cake, grateful for everyone’s effort—even if some words were misspeled along the way.
