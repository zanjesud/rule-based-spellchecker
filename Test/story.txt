Last week, our class went on a trip organized by the goverment. The teacher asked us to seperate into groups and accomodate everyone’s preferences. However, I managed to mispell the name of the place on the form, which caused some confusion. During the journey, my friend tried to make an arguement about which route to take, but we decided to recieve suggestions from everyone. The goverment guide was very helpful and made sure we didn’t miss any important sites. At lunch, we had to accomodate different dietary needs, and I almost forgot to seperate the vegetarian meals. Despite a few mistakes, the trip was a great success. Our teacher praised us for our cooperation, even though I had to correct my mispelling on the feedback form. I learned that it’s important to double-check everything and not make common mistakes, especially when filling out important documents.
